Repository containing all work &amp; documents related to Assignment 3 for GAME-10003-02.

Renewal is a puzzle game where the player must sift through five emails in search for characters that, when put together, make up a passcode. This passcode is needed to enter the admin settings of an OS, so the player character can
return to civilization after stranding themself in the depths of space. 

The player must read emails directed at the player character. Each email contains a character needed for the final passcode- it is up to the player to figure out what the hidden character is in each email. Some are more obvious
than others. 

The player can only read emails while their mouse cursor is hovering over the email title. This makes the player a still target for the invading computer virus. This virus is a cube which blends into the computer's background
very well, and approaches from the RIGHT. The virus will move towards the center of the email tab. If it collides with the tab, the player is met with a game over screen. The virus moves towards the tab quicker when the player's cursor is inside of the tab 
(which will be most of the time while trying to read the emails). There is also a timer in the top-right corner. Once this timer hits certain milestones, the speed increase of the virus becomes faster, making it harder for the 
player to manage the virus while trying to read emails. 

The player can use their cursor to hit the virus- when the cursor collides with the virus, the virus is teleported backwards, and its distance is reset. However, it will keep coming back, so the player must make sure to keep hitting
the virus away whenever it gets close to the email tab. 

As a side note, the player can close the email tab using the red button at the top-right of the tab. This will prevent the virus from colliding with it, and make the tab disappear. This is mainly for the end-game, when the player
will need extra time to input the passcode. 

When the player thinks they have guessed the passcode, they can click the green button in the bottom-left. This will create a prompt in the command console- the player can then input the password. If it is correct, they win the game.
If it is incorrect, they will have to return to the game tab and continue. 

Below are the answers for the passcode:

Passcode: 3*0]U5

How to find '3': The number 3 is mentioned multiple times in the first email and is the only number character. 

How to find '*': Words are blurred out in the second email- these words are covered by asterisks.

How to find '0]': In the third email, there is a typing error at the mention of Exodus Station 0.

How to find 'U': There is a typing error in the word 'continue' in the fourth email- the 'U' in the word is capitalized when it should not be.

How to find '5': Near the end of the final email, 'OS' is spelt incorrectly as 'O5'.
